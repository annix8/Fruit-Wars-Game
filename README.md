# Fruit-Wars-Game

It is a simple and fun game where players can choose warriors, gather fruits to make them stronger, and fight. There are 3 types of warriors: Turtle(1 Speed; 3 power), Monkey(2 Speed; 2 Power), and Pigeon(3 Speed; 1 Power) and 2 types of fruits: Apple(+1 Power), Pear(+1 Speed). The game is played on the console and the first player to start is always Player1. Fruits and Warriors are randomly put on the board. The warriors are marked with their player's number (e.g. 1 or 2) and the fruit with the first letter of the fruit name (capital letter).
